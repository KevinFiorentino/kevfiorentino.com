# Content organization

### How to organize the content with categories, subcategories and tags?

- Each article will have only a category (the directory where it belong)
- Each article could have a subcategory (as a prop)
  - Each article with subcategories belonging to a other category, it should be displayed on the subcategory page too
- Each article will have at least one tag
  - Each tag cannot be a category
